"\nIn this file we have all the top level commands for the transifex client.\nSince we're using a way to automatically list them and execute them, when\nadding code to this file you must take care of the following:\n * Added functions must begin with 'cmd_' followed by the actual name of the\n   command being used in the command line (eg cmd_init)\n * The description for each function that we display to the user is read from\n   the func_doc attribute which reads the doc string. So, when adding\n   docstring to a new function make sure you add an oneliner which is\n   descriptive and is meant to be seen by the user.\n * When including libraries, it's best if you include modules instead of\n   functions because that way our function resolution will work faster and the\n   chances of overlapping are minimal\n * All functions should use the OptionParser and should have a usage and\n   descripition field.\n"
